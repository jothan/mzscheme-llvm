* Check if the name specified in bb_append can be made optional.
   For now, the interface is too incomplete to add branches and other
   crucial flow instructions to test this.
* Figure out the life cycle of values refered by LLVMValueRefs.
   The llvm-c interface does not seem to have any way of tracking
   references made to LLVM values. In the C++ classes, there seems to
   be some magic happening with addUse(). The main question is: are we
   leaking memory ?
* Consult the mzscheme security guard when loading modules.
   I do not know enough to feed the path correctly to the security
   guard. This is a potential security hole for those needing a
   "sandboxed" environment.
